## Description

This is a game app. The first page is a sign in page where you enter your name and city of origin. Then hit the submit button and click on “Take a Tour” which will take you to the main map display page. When you get to the map display page, you will see different icons that are clickable. There are six questions that are linked to the icons. There are also additional icons that are “bonus” features taking you to scenes from Portlandia. After you answer all six questions, you will complete the game. You will then get automatically redirected to the results page. The results are dependent on how you score. There are 3 possible outcomes/results. They are Californian, Poser and True Portlander.
